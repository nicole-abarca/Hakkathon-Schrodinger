# Hakkathon-Schrodinger
Material used and final results by team Schr√∂dinger for the Data Challenge ULACIT 2022. 

The csv files that were uploaded into the CR_datasets_csv and World_datasets_csv are the final clean data sets that were then uploaded into Snowflake. Most of the visualization was made through Tableau which allow us to connect with Snowflake and load the data. 

The final notebook is also available as a .ipynb file.  

*All the final charts and conclusions can be seen in the next Tableau Public Story (https://public.tableau.com/shared/NGY9Y9TRM?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).**
